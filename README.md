## How it started?
The project was 100% custom built for our clients - owners of the property  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61558040110575">Franca</a>.

Patricia and her family wanted to expand their business, not only to use Facebook page, but also to have their own website. They wanted to have professional images and videos to use for better marketing, as well as designing a new logo for their vacation home that would represent it in the best possible way. 

That's where we jumped in. After initial meeting where we discussed about all the things they needed and which our services would they like, our next goal was to create UI prototype of their future website. This house is more than just accommodation; it is a true oasis of peace. In market research phase we wanted to show the advantages of their property. It's ideal for families, friends, anglers, nature lovers, and, of course, their pets! The biggest plus was that the house is located right next to the river Kupa and has private beach, perfect for swimming or diving and exploring the river bottom and it's diverse life. That's why the blue-green color will be dominant.

## PM and UI design
The design was completed just a few days after our first meeting. Our clients requested to have 2 languages (Croatian and English) and incorporate a custom map showcasing various locations such as churches, museums, and beaches onto the page. They provided us with a list of these specific locations. Overall, our clients were pleased with our proposal and agreed to proceed with it. They were also satisfied with our pricing, considering the range of services we would be providing.

Our first task was to focus on capturing great photos for our clients and their visual identity. We made sure to cover both inside and outside shots, including close-ups and aerial views with a drone to showcase the beautiful surroundings of Franca's vacation home by the river. We edited the photos slightly to highlight their best features. The photos were delivered the following day so our clients could use them right away on their Booking site. The promo video was made next. 

We presented several options for creating their visual identity. As previously discussed, the primary colors for the website and photos would be blue and green. Therefore, we designed the logo predominantly in shades of blue. The logo features an abstract design depicting a fisherman and a fish, intertwined with the property name. This design elegantly encapsulates the essence of the property's values, aligning seamlessly with their mission and vision. Our clients found this representation to be a perfect fit and were delighted with the outcome. There were 3 options and our clients chose one they liked the most (2nd photo).

## Project description and features

In addition to showcasing captivating photos, videos, and our client's logo, our website aimed to highlight the property's most appealing features.

### Homepage:

The homepage served as a gateway to the property, offering essential information about the house, nearby attractions, and a selection of compelling photos. It featured a striking aerial hero photo to immediately capture the viewer's attention, followed by carousels displaying various images of the house. Additionally, it included interactive maps showcasing the property's layout and popular destinations in the surrounding area.

### About Us Page:

The "About Us" page provided comprehensive details about the property, including house information and rules. It also boasted a substantial image gallery containing over 50 professionally captured photos, offering potential visitors an immersive visual experience.

### Contact Page:

The third page served as a point of contact, featuring a user-friendly contact form for inquiries and providing essential information regarding check-in and check-out procedures.

This comprehensive approach ensured that our website not only showcased the property's allure but also provided visitors with all the necessary information to plan their stay effectively.
